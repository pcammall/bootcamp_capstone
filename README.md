This is the user-friendly screen that can take a Financial headline. Manually entering text works, but it is more useful to directly copy and paste the headline. It will then process and return the sentiment. It does show both a number and text labels for the sentiment. 



The sentiment_classifier_streamlit_input.py file contains the code to run this via Streamlit.io. Please follow their instructions to install Streamlit on your system before running this file. The code contained within this file is minimal, as it uses a saved model. The training for that model has already occured. Perioditcally the saved model will be updated and improved, which will result in an update to the app that may disrupt usage of it.
